## Create an App

You need to have node.js installed. If you don't, go to https://nodejs.org/, download and install it

Run the following command in the terminal

```
npx create-react-app app-name
```

> [!NOTE]
> While **npm** is a node package manager and will install the package on your machine, **npx** will use the it without downloading or installing anything

---

If you want to initialize react in an existing folder, run the following command
```
npx create-react-app .
```
